        <li>you’re the registered keeper</li>

    <p>You must:</p>

      <li>book your review within 12 months of the date of your application</li>
      <li>{{ testText }}</li>

    </ul><br>

    <p>When the vet has submitted their record of the review, you’ll be notified by email.</p>

    <p>Keep paperwork, such as invoices, from the review as the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) may ask to see it as part of this agreement.</p>

    <p>You’ll be asked to confirm:</p>

        <li>the date of the last visit to the farm for the review if the vet visited more than once</li>
        <li>you agree with the vet's record of the review</li>

    <p>By applying for this funding you're entering into an agreement with the RPA.</p>
