# FFC AHWR Frontend Acceptance Tests

> Future Farming and Countryside Programme - AHWR Frontend Acceptance Tests.

This folder contains the acceptance tests for the AHWR Frontend user facing
`ffc-ahwr-frontend` front end microservice.

The tests use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and
[webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io/). It is based on the
[webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate)
project.
The repo has been containerised so it is easier to run in development and
CI environments.

BrowserStack is used to run the tests to reduce complexity and provide an
improved experience that would otherwise be possible running tests locally.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop 2.2.0.3 (42716) or higher
- Node version 12+ (not compatible with v13)
  - Ideally use the same version as specified by the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
- BrowserStack account
- Have all environment variables specified in a `.env` file

## Quick start

### Running locally

From the project's root dir run `./scripts/acceptance`. This will start the web
app and then run the acceptance tests (after building the image).

### Running against test environment

If the tests are to be run against a test environment there is no need to have
the web app running locally. In this case simply run
`docker-compose up --build` in this directory (i.e. ./test/acceptance).

Running the tests like this will require the env var
`TEST_ENVIRONMENT_ROOT_URL` to be set (see below for more details).

## Environment variables

There are a number of environment variables required to run the tests, in
addition to those required to run the web app. Env vars for the web app are
detailed in the main [README](../../README.md). Test specific env vars are
detailed below.

The env vars are broken down into two sections, the first are env vars required
for running the acceptance tests without any mocking. The second set are
specific to the mocking and will need to be change over time, as the web app
changes the way it communicates with other services.

## Mocking dependent services

The web application integrates with asynchronous APIs (other microservices).
The requests to these microservices tend to be a message sent to a topic or a
queue. If the message is sent to a topic another microservice will be
subscribed to it, if the message is sent to queue there should be a another
microservice processing the requests. Regardless of the communication
mechanism, a response should be sent back to the originating microservice.

When tests are running in an environment where the full stack of
microservices are available e.g. locally, if all microservices have been setup
or any full environment such as SND, PRE or PROD, the messages will be sent,
processed and responded to.
However, if any microservice is not available (such as in the PR environment)
the web application will not work and the tests will fail.

In order to prevent the tests from failing, the responses to the messages the
web app sends are mocked. This is done by subscribing to the topic or listening
to the queue where the message is sent, processing it (using as little logic as
possible) and responding with an appropriate message to the response queue. The
code for this resides within the acceptance test code, and enables bespoke
mocking to easily be added and amended.

A number of elements are required for this to work:

- [pageLoadStrategy](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/page_loading_strategy/)
  needs to be set to `none` - this prevents the browser from
  waiting for the page to load before returning control back to the tests. The
  impact of this is that the tests might try to continue executing actions
  before the page has loaded. To mitigate this, additional pauses are likely
  required within the test steps.
- The env var `PR_BUILD` needs to be set to `true` - this is done automatically
  within the
  [build pipeline](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-jenkins-pipeline-library/blob/496dd5075feea920e4de2596a04a2893affce751/src/uk/gov/defra/ffc/Build.groovy#L16)
  and can be done locally for testing.
- Additional env vars used by the mocking code need to be set and mapped into
  the container.

## Test reports

Test reports will be output to `./html-reports`. Note that WSL users need to
run `mkdir -m 777 html-reports`. Read more about report configuration in the
[wdio-html-nice-reporter docs](https://github.com/rpii/wdio-html-reporter).
